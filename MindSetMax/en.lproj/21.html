<b>The story about NLP</b>
<p/>
Richard Bandler, who was a psychology student with an interest in therapy - was sitting listening to tapes of therapy sessions with the Gestalt therapist Fritz Perls, in California in the 1970's. Richard Bandler thought that he could recognize certain words and sentence structures that changed the client, so he met with John Grinder who was a linguist.
<p/>
Bandler and Grinder decided to examine, how successful therapists managed to help others create positive change, and if there existed certain language patterns that were imperative to their success.
Bandler and Grinder selected three successful terapists: Virginia Satir (family therapy), Fritz Perls (gestalt therapy) and Milton Erickson (hypno therapy) and set out to find, what personal strategies the three therapists used to attain their good results. From the strategies they wished to deduct a model that could be taught and passed on to others.
<p/>
NLP was therefore created through "modeling", i.e. extensive studies of people, where there are experts in each area. Several of the fundamental models and techniques of NLP were created through these studies.
Bandlers and Grinders intention was to create a series of practical tools, that could assist people in creating change. Grinders achievement was first and foremost the study of language patterns. Bandler examined, what our thoughts consist of, and how we can influence our experiences.
<p/>
<b>NLP mindset</b>
<br />By modelling experts and there thought patterns, a certain set of prerequisites were established to make a sound foundation (these are the first four of many):<br />
<br />1.	We don't experience the world, as it is - we experience a Model of the World.
<br />2.	Respect for somebody else's Model of the World.
<br />3.	I am the one that controls my mind and therefore my results.
<br />4.	Fiascos do not exist, only feedback (ie. I learn)
<p/>
<b>Neuro</b><br />
Because it's about the connection between the input, we get from our five senses, and the way we store these input in the brain. 
<p/>
<b>Linguistic</b><br />
Because it's about the connection between the sensory apparatus and the language - and how we can affect our own and other peoples thoughts, with our words. Words activate feelings within us.
<p/>
<b>Programming</b><br />
Because we via inner pictures, sounds, inner dialog and sensing actually "program" ourselves to be either full of resources or energy drained, happy or depressive. And because we through simple techniques can learn to "re-program" ourselves to a wishful change.
