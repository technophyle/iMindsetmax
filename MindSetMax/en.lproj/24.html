<h2>2.4 Thought Field theory</h2>
<p/>
Thought Field Therapy, or TFT, is a psychological treatment developed by an American psychologist, Roger Callahan.<br />
Roger Callahan died in 2013, 88 years old - you may honor his memory <a href="http://www.rogercallahan.com/memories/">here</a> if you wish.<p/>
<p/>
<b>The story about Thought Field Therapy</b>
<p/>
Thought Field Therapy can heal a variety of mental and physical ailments through specialized "tapping" with the fingers at meridian points on the upper body and hands.<p/>
Callahan termed his treatment "Thought Field Therapy" because he theorized that when a person thought about an experience or had thoughts associated with an emotional problem, they were tuning into a "thought field." He described this field as "the most fundamental concept in the TFT system," stating that it "created an imaginary, though quite real scaffold, upon which we may erect our explanatory notions".<br />
Perturbations are said to be precisely encoded information contained in the thought field; each deformation of a person's thought field is connected to a particular problem, and is activated by thinking about that problem. Callahan maintained that these perturbations were the root cause of negative emotions and that each perturbation corresponded to a meridian point on the body. In order to eliminate the emotional upset, Callahan said that a precise sequence of meridian points must be tapped.
<p/>
Callahan stated that the process could relieve a wide variety of psychological issues, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, addiction, and phobia.
<p/>
<b>Thought Field Therapy success rate</b>
<p/>
The algorithms, which work well in about 80% of the cases, were determined through the process of individually diagnosing thousands of clients. The remaining 20% of clients require individual TFT diagnosis of their problems (this requires a live session with a Thought Field Therapist that also practices Applied Kinesiology).
<p/>
Another important aspect of TFT treatment discovered by Dr. Callahan was the psychological reversal (PR). PR creates a polarity block in the body's energy system and prevents an otherwise effective treatment from working. PR is also an important discovery in the areas of psychological and physical healing.
<p/>
It is associated with self defeating and negative behavior, and may be a causal factor for why some people don't heal from either psychological or physical illnesses. Fortunately, there is a quick way to correct a reversal within seconds that enables treatment to become effective once again.
<p/>
TFT is Quick and Effective
<p/>
Although TFT doesn't work for every problem in every person, two studies have shown treatment success rates of well over 90% for a wide variety of psychological problems - anxiety, panic, fears of all types, traumas, painful memories, grief, addictive urges, and depression, just to name a few.
<p/>
Many TFT practitioners treat fears, traumas, and many other conditions daily with TFT with a success rate that surpasses all other forms of psychotherapy. The treatments, which quickly rebalance the body's energy system, are so robust and on line with reality that neither the therapist nor the client have to believe in the treatments for them to work.
