<b>Depression Test</b><br />
Most of us feel sad, discouraged, or “down” once in a while; but for some people, this mood doesn’t go away. If you’re feeling like this for a sustained period – and it gets in the way of daily living – you may be experiencing depression. Taking a Depression Test is a good way to evaluate different aspects of your life at the given moment. It can help identify whether you’re showing some of the signs of depression, and how to go about getting the help that’s right for you.
<p/>
<b>Depression Test and characteristics</b><br />
Depression is an extremely complex disease, as it occurs for a variety of reasons. Some people experience depression during a serious medical illness. Others may have depression with life changes such as a move or the death of a loved one. Still others have a family history of depression. Those who do may experience depression and feel overwhelmed with sadness and loneliness for no known reason. Therefore taking a Depression Test is a view of the moment, and may discover symptoms before the depression gets worse !
<p/>
<b>Depression Test - changes in the brain</b><br />
What happens in the brain to cause depression is not fully understood. Evidence suggests it may be related to changes in the levels or activity of certain chemicals – particularly serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine – which are the three main chemicals related to mood and motivation that carry messages within the brain. Changes to stress hormone levels have also been found in people with depression. Research suggests that behavior can affect brain chemistry – for example, long-term stress may cause changes in the brain that can lead to depression. Changes in brain chemistry have been more commonly associated with severe depression rather than mild or moderate depression.
<p/>
Everyone is different and it’s often a combination of factors that can contribute to a person developing depression. It’s important to note that you can’t always identify the cause of depression or change difficult circumstances. The most important thing is to recognize the signs and symptoms and seek help.
<p/>
Disclaimer:
An Online Depression Test is a preliminary screening test for depressive symptoms that does not replace in any way a formal psychiatric evaluation. It is designed to give a preliminary idea about the presence of mild to moderate depressive symptoms that indicate the need for an evaluation by a psychiatrist.<br />
We believe, that anybody working towards a Growth Mindset and being focused on learning from their mistakes, will more easily recover from mild to moderate depressive symptoms if they arise – by using their brain power and focusing on what’s good in their life – however small that may seem.
Start by asking better questions in the inner dialogue with yourself !
