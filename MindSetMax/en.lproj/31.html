<h2>3.1 Mindsetmax Mindset ABC</h2>
<p/>
Here's food for thought for you to enjoy sound mental health by virtue of a positive mindset - and maximizing your potential:
<p/>
<b>A = Accept</b><br />
Accept yourself, with all that this entails. Know that any flaw that you're conscious about - is usually measurable against media, culture or your relations with other people.
This is therefore far from the truth, merely other people's perceptions translated by you and evaluated so that it has at one point become your truth. By your own choosing.
Take responsibility for your feelings and uninstall such misinformation starting now !<br />

<p/>
<p/>
<b>B = Believe</b><br />
Believe that you're in a friendly Universe. No one was put on this planet to only have a bad time, although free will does rule.<br />
Yes, we have learning experiences that may create pain within us - this is still your choice of perception, relative to the force of the experience and related feeling - so begin today by focusing on human depth and willingness to serve the greater good instead of what is going wrong or bad in the world. Remember to Shine - Be the Miracle!
<p/>
<b>C = Commit</b><br />
Commit to unfolding your purpose in this life. Making a living, as compared to designing a life - may generate unproductive questions within you and clutter the path. Find your purpose and go for it as long as it makes sense!<br />
Another purpose may be waiting, when you've done your best with the previous one【ツ】<br />
Some say, that we're souls with a body contract on this planet to create learning experiences for the soul to ultimately grow!
