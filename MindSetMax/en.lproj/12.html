<h2>1.2 Mindset</h2>
Having a mindset means to act from a set of core beliefs and values, that enhance your state of well being regardless of what is going on in the external world of business, personal relationship hassle or what the broadcast media choose to show you that day.
<p/>
A mindset is a set of assumptions, methods, or notations held by one or more people or groups of people that is so established that it creates a powerful incentive within these people or groups to continue to adopt or accept prior behaviors, choices, or tools.<br />
<b>Changing</b> your mindset is the beginning to changing your life. 
<p/>
It's quite characteristic that there are several kinds of mindsets (= the thoughts that exist in our heads), and that the people who succeed have a special mindset that few know about. We think approx. 12,000 - 50,000 thoughts every day (National Science Foundation, USA) regardless of intelligence, so I'm sure you can imagine that a positive, supportive foundation of thoughts will have a great impact on your day and future life !
<p/>
You can find a version of this mindset with presently living people and authors - i.e. Anthony Robbins, Brian Tracy, Rhonda Byrne, Robert Kiyosaki and Byron Katie (see the links section) - or even other people you know that you believe have succeeded, either if you want happiness or money, or both at the same time【ツ】
<p/>
I have presented and been teaching for more than 100,000+ people, coached more than 20,000+ people, read many books about mindsets from inspirational authors, studied videos and listened to audio books - and after summarizing all this knowledge, I now present to you what I call <b>MINDSETMAX™</b>
<p/>
<b>MINDSETMAX™</b> technology - Grow your mind. Grow your life - consists of 3 steps:<br />
<i>CHANGE - FOCUS - PROGRESS.</i>
<p/>
This app gives you an introduction to the <b>MINDSETMAX™</b> step - CHANGE.
<p/>
The <b>MINDSETMAX™</b> technology is, amongst other theories, founded on NLP, The Enneagram, Metamedicin, Hypnosis and Thought Field Therapy - see more apps on the <a href="EXTERNAL:itms-apps://itunes.com/apps/johnrhodes">App Store</a>:
