<h2>2.3 Metamedicin theory</h2>
<p/>
<b>What is META-Health?</b>
<p/>
META-Health is the art, science and practice of Body-Mind-Social Health with a focus on how specific stress triggers, emotions and beliefs affect specific organ symptoms. META-Health is based on Integrative Medicine and Prevention and is practiced by all types of health professionals interested in a precise and effective Body-Mind-Social diagnosis and therapy. META-Health Professionals are doctors, naturopaths, psychologists, nurses, therapists, counselors and health care providers.
META-Health is about the interconnectedness of Body-Mind-Social and the Art of Self-Healing.
<p/>
To be META-Healthy means you are aware of your bodyâ€™s intelligence, your stress triggers, emotions and beliefs affecting your organ symptoms and you take conscious actions for self-healing and personal growth.<br />

META-Healing or to META-Heal yourself is the multi-dimensional transformation process you will go through to achieve Body-Mind-Social or META-Health.

<p/>
Why am I sick?<br />
What has triggered my symptoms?<br />
Which specific stress and emotions affect my symptoms?<br />
Which specific belief and thought patterns do I need to review?<br />
What can I do to heal naturally?<br />
Which treatments work best for my type of illness?<br />
Do lifestyle changes help me heal myself?<br />
