<b>The story about The Enneagram</b>
<p/>
The word Enneagram comes from greek, where ennea means nine, and gram means model. The Enneagram is therefore a model consisting of 9 points, drawn in a circle, one point for every personality type.<br />
The model is an extract from several of the worlds great philosophical directions; Tibetan mystique, Jewish Kabbalistic training and especially Islamic middleaged philosophers - The Sufis.<p/>
The Enneagram was first known in the the western world thanks to the Armenian philosopher and teacher Georg Ivanovich Gurdjieff (1872-1949) that traveled the world for many years and visited monestaries and mystery schools. In the 1920's he founded the "Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man" in France.
<p/>
The way in which The Enneagram is used today is mainly derived from the Bolivian Oscar Ichazo, that presumably learned about The Enneagram from the same secret mystery school in Afghanistan as Gurdjieff. Oscar Ichazo developed The Enneagram toward the personality model we know today, based on his knowledge of Christian and Jewish mysticism.<br />In the 1970's he started the first public available teaching in Arica, Chile and later founded The Arica Institute in New York.
<p/>
Some of Ichazoâ€™s first students, especially Claudio Naranjo, a psychiatrist and teacher from Chile, continued his work later on and started their own Enneagram schools.<br />
Several books have been written about The Enneagram, mainly in the US. Here, The Enneagram is widely known, as it spreads to the rest of the western world.

The Enneagram is a profound deep description, since it is a mapping of the deepest human motives, for doing what they do. The Enneagram helps us to understand our own and others peoples personality patterns, and by this help us to understand ourselves and our surroundings in a better way. At the same time The Enneagram describes how we can get on and let go of our patterns so that we may achieve a greater contact to our inner core.
<p/>
<b>Wings</b><br />
The circle in The Enneagram denotes the connection, that is between the types, beside each other. Every personality type can be strongly influenced by one or both personality types, that represents the closest neighbor. These are called the types wings.
<p/>
<b>Arrows</b><br />
The Enneagram also explains the change, that happens in our personality, when we experience great personal safety and calm, and when we feel pressure and insecure. During safety and stress we get access to patterns from two other types. These are called the types arrows.
<p/>
<b>Enneagram type 1:</b><br />
The Perfectionist believes you must be good and right to be worthy. Consequently, Perfectionists are conscientious, responsible, improvement-oriented and self-controlled, but also can be critical, resentful and self-judging.
<p/>
<b>Enneagram type 2:</b><br />
The Helper believes you must give fully to others to be loved. Consequently, Helpers are caring, helpful, supportive and relationship-oriented, but also can be prideful, overly intrusive and demanding.
<p/>
<b>Enneagram type 3:</b><br />
The Achiever believes you must accomplish and succeed to be loved. Consequently, Achievers are industrious, fast-paced, goal-focused and efficiency-oriented, but also can be inattentive to feelings, impatient and image-driven.
<p/>
<b>Enneagram type 4:</b><br />
The Romantic believes you must obtain the longed for ideal relationship or situation to be loved. Consequently, Romantics are idealistic, deeply feeling, empathetic and authentic to self, but also dramatic, moody and sometimes self-absorbed.
<p/>
<b>Enneagram type 5:</b><br />
The Investigator believes you must protect yourself from a world that demands too much and gives too little to assure life. Consequently, Investigators seek self-sufficiency and are non-demanding, analytic/thoughtful and unobtrusive, but also can be withholding, detached and overly private.
<p/>
<b>Enneagram type 6:</b><br />
The Loyalist believes you must gain protection and security in a hazardous world you just can't trust. Consequently, Loyalists are themselves trustworthy, inquisitive, good friends and questioning, but also can be overly doubtful, accusatory and fearful.
<p/>

<p/>
<b>Enneagram type 8:</b><br />
