<h2>4.1 Rapport</h2>

<p/>
If you've ever seen two people engaged in conversation, you'll have experienced, that their body language and tone of voice is almost identical. They reach for their glass almost at the same time, and when they change position, the other one also changes position quickly thereafter - quite subconsciously. 
<p/>
When two people have established a good connection, they look alike - body language, tone of voice, wording etc. A subconscious signal is sent, that “I'm like you”, a signal that makes us safe and trusting. 
<p/>
You can use this knowledge about what a good connection entails, to consciously improve connections to other people. This means, that you can learn to match other peoples body language, tone of voice and wording, by which you can send the signal that understand and respect the other persons <a href='SHORTCUT:.2-1.0-0'>Model of the World</a>.
<p/>
In the theory of NLP this is called establishing rapport with another person. Good rapport means good contact on many levels. It means, meeting another person where he/she is, to better get you message through or to assist the other person to get their message through.
<p/>
Rapport is not only about being in rapport with another person, it's also about being in rapport with yourself.
When you're in rapport with yourself, you're in a good state. You're in no way in conflict with yourself, and your verbal and nonverbal communication is congruent (connected).
