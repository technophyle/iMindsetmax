<b>3. SCOPE OF USE</b><br />
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, MINDSETMAX hereby grants You a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to access the Services solely for the personal training or personal reference of Registered Users.

<b>7. TERMINATION</b><br />
MINDSETMAX reserves the right, without notice and in its sole discretion, to terminate this Agreement, and to block or prevent future access to and use of the Site and the Services.

You will not use any such Proprietary Information except in connection with the receipt of Services hereunder.  You specifically agree not to use any Proprietary Information to provide products or services substantially similar to the products or services of MINDSETMAX.  If You are an entity, You will take every such action with Your Registered Users necessary to effectuate the intent of this Section, including without limitation entering into a written confidentiality agreement with such individuals containing terms no less restrictive than those contained in this Section.

<p/> 
<b>9. NO WARRANTIES</b><br />
YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND MINDSETMAX EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. MINDSETMAX MAKES NO WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION REGARDING THE RESULTS THAT MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE USE OF THE SERVICES, REGARDING THE ACCURACY OR RELIABILITY OF ANY INFORMATION OBTAINED THROUGH THE SERVICES, REGARDING ANY GOODS OR SERVICES PURCHASED OR OBTAINED THROUGH THE SERVICES, REGARDING ANY TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO THROUGH THE SERVICES. MINDSETMAX MAKES NO WARRANTY THAT THE SERVICES WILL MEET ANY USER'S REQUIREMENTS, OR BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE OR ERROR FREE. USE OF THE SERVICES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless MINDSETMAX, its officers, directors, employees, consultants, and agents from any and all third party claims, liability, damages and/or costs (including, but not limited to, attorneys fees) arising from Your use of the Sites or the Services or Your violation of this Agreement.
<p/>
<p/>
<b>10. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</b><br />
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL MINDSETMAX BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION, OR ANY OTHER PECUNIARY LOSS OR DAMAGE) ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE SITE, OR THE SERVICES OR MATERIALS SUPPLIED HEREUNDER, WHETHER ARISING IN TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) CONTRACT OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, EVEN IF MINDSETMAX HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN ANY CASE, MINDSETMAX'S MAXIMUM CUMULATIVE LIABILITY AND YOUR EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU FOR THE SERVICES (IF ANY) IN THE PREVIOUS 12 MONTHS. Because some states and jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability, the above limitation may not apply to You.
<p/>

<b>11. MISCELLANEOUS</b><br />
<p/>
11.1 Choice of Law and Forum. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed under the laws of Copenhagen, Denmark, as applied to agreements entered into and to be performed in Copenhagen by Copenhagen residents.

<p/>
11.2 Waiver and Severability. Failure by either party to exercise any of its rights under, or to enforce any provision of, this Agreement will not be deemed a waiver or forfeiture of such rights or ability to enforce such provision. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be amended to achieve as nearly as possible the same economic effect of the original provision and the remainder of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect.
<p/>
11.3 General Provisions. This Agreement embodies the entire understanding and agreement between the parties respecting the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes any and all prior understandings and agreements between the parties respecting such subject matter.
